## Exercise: 29

Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) are registered not more than once a day for each collection point [i.e. the primary key consists of (point, date)], write a query displaying cash flow data (point, date, income, expense).

Use Income_o and Outcome_o tables.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
		WHEN i.point IS NULL THEN o.point
		ELSE i.point
	END AS point, 
    CASE 
		WHEN i.date IS NULL THEN o.date
		ELSE i.date
	END AS date, 
    i.inc, 
    o.out
FROM income_o i
	FULL JOIN outcome_o o
	ON i.date = o.date
		AND i.point = o.point

```
