One of the characteristics of a ship is one-half the cube of the calibre of its main guns (mw).
Determine the average ship mw with an accuracy of two decimal places for each country having ships in the database.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT country
	, CONVERT(NUMERIC(6, 2), AVG(power(bore, 3)) * 0.5) AS weight
FROM (
	SELECT country, bore, name
	FROM Ships
		JOIN Classes ON Ships.class = Classes.class
	UNION
	SELECT country, bore, ship
	FROM Outcomes
		JOIN Classes ON Outcomes.ship = Classes.class
) all_ships
GROUP BY country
```
