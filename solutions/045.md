## Exercise: 45

Find all ship names consisting of three or more words (e.g., King George V).

Consider the words in ship names to be separated by single spaces, and the ship names to have no leading or trailing spaces.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT name
FROM (
	SELECT class AS name
	FROM classes
	UNION
	SELECT name
	FROM ships
	UNION
	SELECT ship AS name
	FROM outcomes
) all_ships
WHERE name LIKE '% % %'
```
