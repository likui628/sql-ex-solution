## Exercise: 51

Find the names of the ships with the largest number of guns among all ships having the same displacement (including ships in the Outcomes table).

## Solution

```sql
WITH all_ships AS (
		SELECT name, numGuns, displacement
		FROM ships
			JOIN classes ON classes.class = ships.class
		UNION
		SELECT ship AS name, numGuns, displacement
		FROM outcomes
			JOIN classes ON outcomes.ship = classes.class
	)

SELECT name
FROM all_ships
	JOIN (
		SELECT displacement, MAX(numGuns) AS maxNumGUns
		FROM all_ships
		GROUP BY displacement
	) t
	ON all_ships.displacement = t.displacement
		AND all_ships.numGuns = maxNumGUns
```
