## Exercise: 16

Get pairs of PC models with identical speeds and the same RAM capacity. Each resulting pair should be displayed only once, i.e. (i, j) but not (j, i).

Result set: model with the bigger number, model with the smaller number, speed, and RAM.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.model, b.model, a.speed, a.ram
FROM pc a
	INNER JOIN pc b ON a.model > b.model
WHERE a.speed = b.speed
	AND a.ram = b.ram
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.model, b.model, a.speed, a.ram
FROM pc a, pc b
WHERE a.model > b.model
	AND a.speed = b.speed
	AND a.ram = b.ram
```
