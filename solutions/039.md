## Exercise: 39

Find the ships that `survived for future battles`; that is, after being damaged in a battle, they participated in another one, which occurred later.

## Solution

```sql
WITH allships AS (
		SELECT *
		FROM outcomes o
			JOIN battles b ON o.battle = b.name
	)

SELECT DISTINCT ship
FROM allships r1
WHERE r1.result = 'damaged'
	AND EXISTS (
		SELECT *
		FROM allships r2
		WHERE r1.date < r2.date
			AND r1.ship = r2.ship
	)
```
