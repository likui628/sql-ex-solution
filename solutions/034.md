## Exercise: 34

In accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty concluded in the beginning of 1922, it was prohibited to build battle ships with a displacement of more than 35 thousand tons.
Get the ships violating this treaty (only consider ships for which the year of launch is known).

List the names of the ships.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT name
FROM classes
	JOIN ships ON classes.class = ships.class
WHERE displacement > 35000
	AND launched >= 1922
	AND type = 'bb'
```
